# Object Oriented Programming

## Concepts of OOPS in C++
- function Overloading: Function can have the same name but different parameters.
- Object Oriented Programming
    - ### Why OOPS?
        - As the size of program increases the readability, maintainbility and bug free nature of program decrease.
        - This was the major problem with C language which relied upon function or procedures.(Hence named as procedural programming language)
        - Data security is another main concern in C language. 
    - ### Proceducal Oriented Programming
        - The main focus is on function not in flow of data.
        - Function can either use local or global data.
        - Data movers openly from function to function.
    - ### Object Oriented Programming
        - It is programming paradigm that is defined using Object instead of only functions 
        - The object contain propeties (data members) and behaviors (function or member function)
    - ### Programming Paradigms 
        - The method of classification of programming language based on their features.
        - Mainly two types:
            - Imperative Programming Paradigm
                - Procedural Programming Paradigm
                - Object-Oriented Programming or OOP
                - Parallel Programming
            - Declarative Programming Paradigm
                - Logical Programming Paradigm
                - Functional Programming Paradigm
                - Database Programming Paradigm
        - ### What are features of OOPS?
            - Four main features:
                - Encapsulation
                - Data Abstraction
                - Inheritance
                - Polymorphism
        - ###  What are the advantages of OOPS?
            - Improves maintainablity of the code.
            - Helpful in solving complex problems.
            - Bottom up approach.
            - Promotes code reuse, which reducing redundancy.
            - Hides unnecessay details with the help of Data Abstraction.
            - Polymorphism offers a lot of flexibility.
